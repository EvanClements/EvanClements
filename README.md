- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EvanClements
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new things
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to work with microcontrollers (particularly ESP32 and Arduino/MicroPython), about how to restore/upgrade iPod Classics (4th/5th gen in particular), and the Crystal programming language

- Some of my current ideas that I would like to dive into:
  - A GreenButton App : I would like to create an app that can parse the GreenButton XML provided by utility companies and display it as an easy to consume graph
  - An ESP32-based drop in replacement for the internals of an iPod Classic. It would allow the use of the existing Click Wheel, Headphone Jack, Hold switch, and potentially the existing screen.
  - A [Beets.io](http://beets.io/) clone (written in Crystal)
  - An Alexa-enabled smart nightlight which plays music 
  - A [USDA FoodData](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html) search (start with CLI, might make a webapp later)
